		<div class="foodtitle">1) Morro Rock</div>
		<div class="explorecontent"><p>
			Morro Bay is known for the famous rock and the beach. You can reach the rock from many different locations all around the town, but driving past the embarcadero will get you right to it. The rock is off limits, so make sure you do not climb it, unless you want to be fined $10,000. We suggest to walk along the beach in the early morning, or when the sun goes down to take in the beautiful scenery.</p>

		<div class="explorecontent"><p>
			Big Sur is a rugged stretch of California’s central coast between Carmel and San Simeon. Bordered to the east by the Santa Lucia Mountains and the west by the Pacific Ocean, it’s traversed by narrow, 2-lane State Route 1, known for winding turns, seaside cliffs and views of the often-misty coastline. The sparsely populated region has numerous state parks for hiking, camping and beachcombing.

		<div class="foodtitle">4) Pirates Cove</div>
		<div class="explorecontent"><p>
Pirate’s Cove is a well-known clothing optional beach between Avila Beach and the Shell Beach area of Pismo Beach, CA. This south-facing cove is somewhat protected from the weather and attracts many locals looking for a comfortable clothingless beach atmosphere. Pirate’s Cave and other sea caves are nearby so the area on the bluff has been named Cave Landing. Travel down the coast to explore, and maybe find some treasure!</p>
