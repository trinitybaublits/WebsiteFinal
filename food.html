		<p class="description">
			The Harbor Hut restaurant located on the waterfront in Morro Bay is known for having one of the best views of the bay and Morro Rock of any restaurant in Morro Bay. A favorite among visitors and locals alike, the Harbor Hut has been a Morro Bay icon and has been family owned and operated since 1951. Established as a humble little spot dedicated to cooking up the freshest seafood possible, the Harbor Hut soon became well known as one of the best restaurants on the Central Coast for their mesquite broiling and their insatiable quest for the finest ingredients.
