	<h1>Morro Bay, CA</h1>
	<p>A Picture Perfect Town</p>

<p>Everything about lovely Morro Bay, California located on the Pacific Coast of California about half way between San Francisco and Los Angeles near Hearst Castle and the Big Sur Coast. Morro Bay is a working fishing village. Its famous landmark, Morro Rock, was named by Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo when he first charted this coast during his 16th Century voyage of discovery. The town is a pleasant tourist destination which has very mild weather all year long. There is no such thing as traffic in Morro Bay, unless, of course, you count birds, sea mammals, and fish!  </p>
